This respository keeps a patch which implements a set of Linux multiprocessor
CPU Bandwidth Control Interfaces based on the idea of Open-Extension 
Container. The path is for 3.4-rc1. 

2012-5-17 afternnon :
In this version, when a task group(except for the root task group) is created,
it is associated with a hyper_irmos_rq. And tasks attached to this group are 
scheduled above the "struct rq" belonging to the hyper_irmos_rq.
requirements:
	CONFIG_SMP disabled
	CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED and CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED set

2012-5-17 afternnon - v2 :
requirements:
	CONFIG_SMP disabled

2012-5-18 afternoon :
Improvements: 
	Now, a task can join a per-container scheduling system no matter 
	Linux group scheduling is enabled or not.     
	Still, the codes are experimental: when a new cgroup(except for the 
	root one) is created, it is associated with a hyper_irmos_rq and its 
	tasks are scheduled under the hyper_irmos_rq's scheduling system.
requirements:
	CONFIG_SMP disabled


2012-5-22 evening:
Improvements:
	The bandwidth reservation for cfs tasks works. However, the statistical 
	data recorded is not right.
